                            Talkmap is a SaaS company working in the conversational intelligence space. They provide conversational analytics for their clients via their AI platform. 
                            For this project, Talkmap's goal was to creatively communicate their founding ideas in a way that could be easily understood across audiences. 
                            They were looking for content that they could repurpose across platforms, including their website, email, and social media.

                            When designing for this project, the three most salient words were <strong>clean, clear, and approachable.</strong> 
                            The challenge came when trying to take these heavily technical concepts and break them down into digestible snippets that could be understood both independently and as a series.
                            So, when designing, I returned to Talkmap's source material and really dove into what made their company unique. Using content written by one of their executives, 
                            I gained a clear picture of the four main principles upon which Talkmap was founded, and the Foundations series was born. <br><br>Once the idea for this series took hold, the visuals were quick to follow. 
                            We wanted something in a simple style, nothing too flashy as to distract from the bulk of the information that would be narrated over the video, but engaging enough to call attention to the key concepts in each installment.
                            So, I decided on a simple, 2D animation style to achieve this goal of clean and clear communication. After storyboarding and getting the initial concept and designs approved, the Foundations series took off, resulting in 4 complete installments (all designed in shades of Talkmap blue, of course! üòâ).

                        One of the client's main goals was to be able to repurpose this content and utilize it as a source of truth both internally and externally for who they are as a company and why they do what they do.
                        The videos were able to be used across social media platforms, and resulted in engagement above their account average, in some cases <strong>more than double the average engagement</strong> on their posts.
                        Additionally, the videos were used to <strong>drive traffic to the client's website</strong>, as the animations were ublished in conjuction with article segments diving deeper into the context of these four founding principles.
                        Plus, these videos, in conjuction with the accompanying article, were <strong>presented to key stakeholders</strong> as a representation of the benefits of the current innovations we were undertaking with the company's marketing activities.
