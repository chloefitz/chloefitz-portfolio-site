                                Talkmap is a SaaS company working in the conversational intelligence space. They provide conversational analytics for their clients via their AI platform. 
                                For this project, Talkmap's goal was to creatively communicate their founding ideas in a way that could be easily understood across audiences. 
                                They were looking for content that they could repurpose across platforms, including their website, email, and social media.

                                I've always had a soft spot for any video game done using pixel art. I find that there's something so beautiful about being able to still communicate visually while working in such a pared down style. 
                                Games like Eastward and Celeste are some of my favorites when it comes to pixel art games. Eastward especially, I think, does a great job of balancing the nostalgic, pixel art style with artistry.
                                <br><br>When I got this assignment, I wanted to push myself to be able to tell a story using this more simplistic art style. The choice to animate in the style of a video game was representative of the larger
                                themes I wanted to communicate. Just like in a side scrolling video game, you don't know what will come next, but you know you have to keep moving.
                                The format of the video game, and the idea that the main character has to keep moving forward resonnated with me and made the animation process more personal.

                                In the end, I was able to present an animation that I was, and still am, really proud of. 
                                I was able to tell the story I wanted‚Äîthat in order to keep moving forward, 
                                you have to make decisions even if the outcome is unknown, 
                                and that sometimes you just need to pause and breathe to ground yourself and keep moving forward‚Äîand got to experiment with an art style that I've always admired. 
                                This will always be a very special project to me, and I'm so happy that I've gotten the chance to share it with you üëæ.
